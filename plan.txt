  - repeators are contextually related to the next higher element in that they repeat
    within the context of the enclosing element.
      e.g.
        wday pertains to months.
        minutes pertain to hours
  - elements can be calculated or specified.
  - for prior fields that are calculated, an iterator is every iteration field.
  - for prior fields that are specific, an iterator is every iteration from that point.
      
  - something like +N, where N is applied to the field in which it's used.
    - every hour, every day, every seven months starting March 2009

      */*/* 01:00(+45)

      */*/* 01:00(+90)
    - every 90 minutes starting at 01:00am, every day
      */*/* 01(+1):00(+30)

  The following calculate-month context means the iterator is only valid until
     the end of a month.

    - every 90 minutes starting at 01:00am, from the second of the every month
      */*/2 01:00(+90)
    - every 90 minutes starting at 01:00am, from the third of the every month
      */*/3 01(+1):00(+30)
    - every 90 and 150 minutes starting at 01:00am, from the third of the every month
      */*/3 01(+1,+2):00(+30)
    - every 60 and 150 minutes starting at 01:00am, from the third of the every month
      */*/3 01(+1,+2):00(+0,+30)


    - Every hour on the third Monday of every month
